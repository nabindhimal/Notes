local variables --> lives inside the created method

instance variable --> created inside the class not inside the method --> private int x;

class variable --> similar to instance variable but its shared by all instances meaning no copies of it are created and the reference is passed --> private static int x;

constants --> private static final int X = 0;

// Every class that one creates that does not extends(classes that extends can also have this method) any other class should have a toString() method.
eg: public String toString() {
	return // here it should return information about the class.
}



### Java Review: Putting It All Together

In this lesson, we’ve started writing our first programs in Java.

We’ve also learned rules and guidelines for how to write Java programs:

- Java programs have at least one class and one `main()` method.
    - Each class represents one real-world idea.
    - The `main()` method runs the tasks of the program.
- Java [comments](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/comments) add helpful context to human readers.
- Java has whitespace, curly braces, and semicolons.
    - Whitespace is for humans to read code easily.
    - Curly braces mark the scope of a class and method.
    - Semicolons mark the end of a statement.
- Java is a compiled language.
    - Compiling catches mistakes in our code.
    - Compilers transform code into an executable class.

# 1. List the steps  involved in white box testing.

White box testing, also known as structural testing or glass box testing, involves examining the internal structures of the software being tested. Here are the steps typically involved in white box testing:

1. **Understanding Requirements**: Ensure a thorough understanding of the software requirements and specifications.
    
2. **Code Analysis**: Analyze the source code to identify all possible paths, conditions, and loops.
    
3. **Test Case Design**: Design test cases based on the internal logic of the code, including paths, conditions, and loops. Test cases should cover all branches and statements in the code.
    
4. **Test Case Execution**: Execute the designed test cases on the software.
    
5. **Coverage Analysis**: Measure the code coverage achieved by the executed test cases. Code coverage metrics include statement coverage, branch coverage, path coverage, and condition coverage.
    


# 2. List the pros and cons  of white box testing.

## The advantages of white box testing:

- The transparency of this type of testing allows the testing to be extensive, as the tester can do comprehensive tests covering all the paths and testing the entire structure and code base. It also assesses internal and external vulnerabilities that could help avoid future security threats and attacks. 
    
- Less time to perform white box testing – While the time required to perform white box testing may become a con when it comes to an extensive, complex application, which we mention later in the blog, but when all the available information about the application is available, it takes less time for the tester to go in, understand the code swiftly and perform the checks, but with large applications with complex functionalities, the testing can run into weeks or months. 
    
- The test cases can be easily automated, and many tools are available for performing automation, which expedites these tasks.
    
- Code optimization – White box testing helps remove extra lines of code and identify hidden errors. There is a higher chance of detecting security risks or bugs due to all the information available about the application. 
    
- The process of white box testing can start early in the Software Development Lifecycle Process (SDLC), even before the user interface comes about. This gives the developer a chance to fix the bugs early on or add elements to improve security in the early stages of the development process.  
    
- No requirement of an interface as is needed in other types of testing, such as black box testing.


## The disadvantages of white box testing:

- Certain functionalities could be missed out as only the available code is tested.
    
- Many developers are against it as it is a tedious process.
    
- It is very time-consuming as the codes must be redesigned along with test cases that need to be rewritten. 
    
- Requires resources and professional skills as testers with in-depth programming skills are necessary, unlike in black box testing. In white box testing, a tester is expected to understand the mechanism of the codebase of the application and have strong programming language knowledge.

1. Linux is a kernel that powers the linux operating system.
2. Kernels are programs that talk directly to the hardware and manage resources and processes.
3.  Kernels need a whole operating system to be useful.
4.  When a Linux Kernel is bundled with operating system software and shipped together, that is called a Linux Distribution.


## Linux Distributions

1. Red Hat Family
2.  Debian Family
3.  Source Code Distributions
4.  System V Init VS SystemD


## Hardware Considerations

1. Can your machine boot the installation media?
2. how much hard drive space you need?
3. how much ram you need?
4. Will your video card work?
5. Will your wireless card work?
6. What other hardware needs to work?

## Time and Date

1. How does a computer clock work?
2.  Why do time zones matter?
3.  Stored as localtime or UTC? What is the difference?
	:  Windows machine uses localtime for everything, but if u move ur computer from one time zone to another, then every thing must be calculated again.
	: Linux stores time as UTC , so all it requires is what time zone i'm in, so when it reads from the computer, it immediately translated to the correct time zone.
1.  How does network time work?
    : Network Time communicates over the network, u send a requets to the server, the server sends the time as UTC and u have to calculate it and convert it to ur localtime.


## Software Selections

1. Which software should I use?
2.  What type of machine do I have?
3.  Can I install packages later?
    : Yes, everything you can do during installation, you can also do later.
1.  Where does the software comes from?
2.  What are requirements of different packages?

Speed in network is measured in bits per second not bytes per second. Collection of 8 bites is a byte.
RJ45 cable is used for connecting in Ethernet ports.

1 kilobite (Kb) = 1000 bits
1 megabit (Mb) = 1,000,000 bits
1 gigabit (Gb) = 1,000,000,000 bits
1 terabit (Tb) = 1,000,000,000,000 bits

Ethernet Standards

+ Defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983.
+ IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

The copper cables used in ethernet standards are UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair ) cables. 

2 RJ 45 connection

a. straight through cable -->  same pine connection, used for different device connection
b. crossover cable -->

Auto MDI-X allows devices which pins neighbours are using for receiving and transmit data nad adjust accordingly.

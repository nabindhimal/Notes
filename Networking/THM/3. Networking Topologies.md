A `network topology` is a typical arrangement and `physical` or `logical` connection of devices in a network. Computers are `hosts`, such as `clients` and `servers`, that actively use the network. They also include `network components` such as `switches`, `bridges`, and `routers`.


The network topology determines the components to be used and the access methods to the transmission media.



We can divide the entire network topology area into three areas:

#### 1. Connections

|`Wired connections`|`Wireless connections`|
|---|---|
|Coaxial cabling|Wi-Fi|
|Glass fiber cabling|Cellular|
|Twisted-pair cabling|Satellite|
|and others|and others|


#### 2. Nodes - Network Interface Controller (NICs)

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Repeaters|Hubs|Bridges|Switches|
|Router/Modem|Gateways|Firewalls||

Network nodes are the `transmission medium's connection points` to transmitters and receivers of electrical, optical, or radio signals in the medium.


#### 3. Classifications

We can imagine a topology as a virtual form or `structure of a network`. This form does not necessarily correspond to the actual physical arrangement of the devices in the network.


Network topologies are divided into the following eight basic types:

|---|---|
|Point-to-Point|Bus|
|Star|Ring|
|Mesh|Tree|
|Hybrid|Daisy Chain|

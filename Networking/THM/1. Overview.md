A network enables two computers to communicate with each other. There is a wide array of `topologies` (mesh/tree/star), `mediums` (ethernet/fiber/coax/wireless), and `protocols` (TCP/UDP/IPX) that can be used to facilitate the network. It is important as security professionals to understand networking because when the network fails, the error may be silent, causing us to miss something.

The difference between `URL`s and `FQDN`s is that:

- an `FQDN` (`www.hackthebox.eu`) only specifies the address of the "building" and
- an `URL` (`https://www.hackthebox.eu/example?floor=2&office=dev&employee=17`) also specifies the "`floor`," "`office`," "`mailbox`" and the corresponding "`employee`" for whom the package is intended.

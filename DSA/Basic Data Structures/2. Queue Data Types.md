Queues are FIFO data structures.
Its a linear data structure.
FIFO--> First In First Out
Like a line of people.

head ->1st element
tail -> last element

Queue is an interface so we cannot create an instance of interface.

offer() --> add         add()
poll() --> remove   remove()
peek() --> view        element()

contains()

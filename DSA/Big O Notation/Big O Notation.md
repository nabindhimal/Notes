"How code slows as data grows"

1. Describes the performance of an algorithm as the amount of data increases.
2. Machine independent (# of steps to completion)
3. Ignore smaller operations O(n +1) -> O(n)

example :      n =   amount of data(its a variable like x.

O(1)
O(n)   --> linear time --> has runtime complexity of O(n)
O(log n)
O(n^2)
